Hi mighty alpha tester! Here the binaries are stored. Simply download **FireBraid.zip**, extract and enjoy. 

## Controls:
w, a, d = walk & jump
h = level editor (AIDE)  
v = activates effects that won't be in finished game but still look great
n = restarts current level
m = will return you to the level selector
c = cast fireball (either pickup firefly or activate cheat mode to perform this)

## Dev team:
- Standa: artist, designer
- Lof: programmer, the one responsible for everything that goes wrong

## Bug reporting
